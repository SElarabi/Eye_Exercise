# Eye_Exercise

<h3> Description <h3>
<p> Web page with two eyes that follows your mouse movement.</p>
<article>
<p> This Demo is a JavaScript application that utilizes HTML and CSS to create an image of eyes on the webpage. Instead of using an image file, the image is created using HTML components such as div, span, and containers.<br>
The JavaScript component of the project uses mouse event listeners to detect the movement of the cursor on the screen and updates the position of the eye elements accordingly. The position of the eye elements is updated in real-time, so that it appears as if the eyes are following the movement of the cursor, simulating the effect of eye tracking. This approach allows for more flexibility and control over the design of the eyes, and creates an interactive and immersive experience for the user. <br>
This project could be used in website design, gaming, or other interactive applications to create a more engaging experience for the user.
