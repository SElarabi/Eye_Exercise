## Description ##
<p> Web page with two eyes that follows mouse movement.</p>

## How to Run ##
<p> This Demo,instead of using an image file, a JavaScript application coded in eye.js file utilizes HTML elements and style them with style.css to create an image of eyes on the webpage . <br> 

The JavaScript component of the project uses mouse event listeners to detect the movement of the cursor on the screen and updates the position of the eye elements accordingly. <br>
The position of the eye elements is updated in real-time, so that it appears as if the eyes are following the movement of the cursor, simulating the effect of eye tracking. This approach allows for more flexibility and control over the design of the eyes, and creates an interactive and immersive experience for the user. <br>
This project could be used in website design, gaming, or other interactive applications to create a more engaging experience for the user.
